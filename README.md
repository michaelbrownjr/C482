Inventory Management System app created for class demonstrating MVC practices and object-oriented programming.

This project is a multiple-screen, JavaFX application to manage an inventory system for parts and products. The application allows users to enter, edit, and delete parts (In-House or Out-Sourced) and products data information. It should validate the data entered by the user. This application will NOT persist data into a database.
